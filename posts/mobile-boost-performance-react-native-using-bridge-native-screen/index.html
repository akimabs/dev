<a href=#intro class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>The topic of native code bridges is an ongoing challenge, especially when React Native&rsquo;s latest documentation when this was written
are still marks some features as <a href=https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/pillars-fabric-components><strong>experimental</strong></a>. based on this reason i do research into bridging native screens into React Native&rsquo;s base code seems like a promising initiative. This could potentially serve as a pathway for developers to refactor towards pure native code, such as Java/Kotlin and Swift, without abandoning React Native side.</p><h2 id=problem>Problem
<a href=#problem class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>One of the challenges with managing multiplatform software development is the laborious efforts of creating & maintaining parity for every identical component constantly across platforms.</p></blockquote><p>I think all React Native devs know the deal, screens built with React Native don&rsquo;t quite match up in performance with those crafted in pure native code, like Kotlin/Java and Swift</p><p>But it&rsquo;s a common struggle to deals with performance issue. With so much existing React Native codebases in companies, we&rsquo;re kinda stuck rolling with it. and gotta keep optimizing performance using tricks like <strong>memoizing components</strong>, <strong>preventing unnecessary component updates</strong>, <strong>handling primitive data updates</strong>, <strong>caching</strong>, and the whole shebang.</p><h2 id=solution>Solution
<a href=#solution class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>For now, I&rsquo;ll be dividing this into several threads that you can read sequentially. This will serve as a flow to understand the correct sequence for implementing the Native Screen bridge.</p><ul><li>Mobile: Boost Performance React Native Create Your First Native Screen<ul><li>Jetpack Compose</li><li>Swift UIKIT</li></ul></li><li>Mobile: Boost Performance React Native Integrate With Navigating Between Native Screen</li><li>Mobile: Boost Performance React Native Call Your Cache Data Across Native Screen<ul><li>Deals with react native async storage between native side</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2024 Akimabs</span></div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.js></script></div></body></html>
