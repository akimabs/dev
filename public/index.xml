          Intro # The topic of native code bridges is an ongoing challenge, especially when React Native&amp;rsquo;s latest documentation when this was written are still marks some features as experimental. based on this reason i do research into bridging native screens into React Native&amp;rsquo;s base code seems like a promising initiative. This could potentially serve as a pathway for developers to refactor towards pure native code, such as Java/Kotlin and Swift, without abandoning React Native side.
